# Moodlist - Analyze your Mood through discord, and generate a unique playlist based upon your mood.
<hr><br>

<strong>Instead of running this code yourself, it is much easier to invite Moodlist to your server. Head over to [moodlist.xyz](https://moodlist.xyz) and login to invite the bot!</strong>

## Analyzing your mood
<hr><br>

Moodlist will automatically determine your mood through a python library called [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/), and will use this number to speak to the web API written to generate playlists. You can run <strong>[prefix]whatsmymood</strong> to check what your mood is before running <strong>[prefix]generate mood</strong>

## Generating Spotify Playlists
<hr><br>

Using a custom API written for the bot, Moodlist will determine the mood of hundreds of Spotify Tracks, and will return the ones it believes are best suited for you.

## Saving your playlists
<hr><br>

Another unique feature of moodlist is the ability to save your playlists through the website, and make them public to share with your friends. After generating a playlist, you can run <strong>[prefix]playlist save PLAYLIST NAME</strong>. Then head over to [moodlist.xyz/playlists](https://moodlist.xyz/playlists) to edit them!

<hr><br>

I look forward to updating this bot in the future, and keeping it running for people to enjoy. If you have any questions, head over to [moodlist.xyz](https://moodlist.xyz) and click the "Support" button in the nav bar!
